# Image files
Image files are stored on https://files.rb9.xyz/prootify/.

Some image files are bootstrapped manually (Ubuntu, Debian, Kali, Parrot, and Blackbox) whereas others are mirrored from their respective sources.

Here's the full list of distros and architectures:

| Distro | Arch | PRootify URL |
